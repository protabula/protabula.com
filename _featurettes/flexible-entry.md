Data collection will be more flexible based on student behavioral need rather than an "one-size-fits-all" form. Educators can share critical information for their buddy teacher using a Quick Form. If the event requires additional support, the educator can use the Full Form for detailed data collection and escalate the event to notify focus teacher & administration.
