ProTabula license services are based on per student, per school year fees. The fee to activate license will be based on number of unique students entered into the system after two weeks into the school year. PROTABULA will not credit license fees for any reason at any time.
Certain “License Services” are available only from PROTABULA via a dedicated service to which the following applies:
* (a) CUSTOMER agrees to pay, using a valid credit card, purchase order, or check which PROTABULA accepts, the license fees set forth by PROTABULA, applicable taxes, and other charges incurred on the account of CUSTOMER in order to access, print and use the License Services. PROTABULA reserves the right to change fees, or to institute new fees at the end of each license year, upon reasonable notice posted in advance on www.ProTabula.com or as otherwise provided. PROTABULA LICENSE SERVICES MUST BE RENEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. PROTABULA DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY RENEW LICENSES.

Failure to provide and maintain accurate, current and complete information may, at the option of PROTABULA, result in immediate suspension or termination of this Agreement and the License Services.

### 8. Multi Customer Accounts

This license for each License Service creates a single account. CUSTOMER may then create additional users within that account, and users that CUSTOMER creates, imports, and/or any other kind of user creation within the account shall be fully subject to this Agreement.

### 9. Password

As part of the registration process for License Services, CUSTOMER will receive a temporary password via user’s login email address. CUSTOMER is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the CUSTOMER password and agrees that PROTABULA has no obligations with regard to the use by third parties of such password. CUSTOMER is entirely responsible for any activity occurring under the CUSTOMER account and password. CUSTOMER agrees to notify PROTABULA immediately if CUSTOMER has any reason to believe that the security of CUSTOMER data or any password has been compromised.

### 10. Privacy & Security

PROTABULA has taken reasonable actions, including use of encryption and firewalls, to ensure that data and information of CUSTOMER is disclosed only to those designated by CUSTOMER, as set forth in the applicable Privacy Policy posted below on this agreement. However, CUSTOMER acknowledges that the Internet is an open system and PROTABULA cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that third parties will not intercept same.

### 10a. Privacy Policy.

We provide the following privacy policy in this Section 10a (the “Privacy Policy”) in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Service and not to information collected offline. Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to ProTabula by email at info@ProTabula.com.
There are two kinds of information that we may obtain about you: (1) Anonymous Information and (2) Personally Identifiable Information.
(i) Anonymous Information – “Anonymous Information” is data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. Anonymous Information is aggregate data that websites and applications use to administer their sites and services and the contents thereon and therein. This Anonymous Information comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, and may include such information as your browser or device type or your Internet Protocol (IP) address (if not deleted, clipped or anonymized), log file information, cookie information, web beacons and similar tracking technologies. You can change your browser or device settings to prevent cookies or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. However, if you disable or block cookies on your browser or device, the features on our Service may not work correctly. ProTabula also collects and uses city and state location information about Users. ProTabula may from time to time retain third parties to help us collect and aggregate information.
(ii) Personally Identifiable Information – In connection with the Service, we and our providers collect and/or use certain information that can be used to identify or contact you, including without limitation your personal information for maintaining your account (such as your user name, email address, phone number, first and last name, Site name and address, and a photograph or avatar). In addition, when you post or submit information or otherwise provide communications, comments or other Service to the Service, all such information is collected by us or our providers in order to provide the Service. By using certain features of the Service, you will also be providing additional personal information to ProTabula, including without limitation your location, members of your network, and your usage patterns of the Service. Further, when you contact us, we may ask for your name, password, email address and/or other information regarding your account so we may process and respond to your request.
Anonymous Information is used internally for the administration, troubleshooting, data analysis, auditing, and research of our Service to help improve the quality, design and information provided to you. Some examples of the kinds of Anonymous Information we may collect include device identifiers, information about your usage of features of the Service and other data generated during your interactions with the Service. We may share such aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, such as demographics and general analytics regarding usage of the Service, with existing and prospective business partners, clients and advertisers. We never connect aggregate information with personally identifiable information, and none of the Anonymous Information we share
We collect personally identifiable information about users only when the user voluntarily provides such information, including patterns of application usage. (Personally identifiable information is any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual and any other information about that individual.) We may be required to transfer or disclose personally identifiable information to third parties without prior consent if required by law, such as a court-ordered subpoena, search warrant, or other court order, or if required by exigent circumstances. Without limiting the foregoing, we may share your personally identifiable information with representatives of the Site (including without limitation the Site administrators), solely in connection with your use of the Service. We also may use (and may contract with carefully selected third-party service providers to help us use) your profile information on an aggregate
basis – without personal identifiers – and other usage information that is useful in developing new features and content for the Service. Some examples of the usage information we may collect and use on an aggregate basis include without limitation using and publishing anonymized data that is not identifiable by student or user but may be identified by state and/or Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and analysis of narrative comments recorded by users (e.g., frequency of certain words appearing in comments). In addition, we reserve the right to use and publish city, state, and school name of active ProTabula sites, including the Site. You understand and agree that your information and data provided by or otherwise collected or generated in connection with your use of the Service, including without limitation personally identifiable information is subject to the rights and licenses granted to ProTabula herein.
As ProTabula continues to develop the Service and business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, information collected through the Service may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the unlikely event that a portion or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third party, such information would likely be one of the transferred business assets.
Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. The Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) defines a “Child” as anyone under the age of
We strictly adhere to COPPA. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information obtained through the Service from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of the Service are structured to attract anyone under 13.

### 11. Server Availability and Scheduled Down Times

Third-party server maintenance is routinely performed and CUSTOMER may experience some down times in usage based upon the needed improvements. In the event a mission-critical maintenance situation arises, PROTABULA may be required to perform emergency maintenance at any time. During these scheduled and emergency maintenance periods, CUSTOMER may be unable to transmit and receive data. CUSTOMER agrees to accept the risk of such unavailability and to fully cooperate with PROTABULA during the scheduled and emergency maintenance periods.

### 12. Indemnification

CUSTOMER hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless PROTABULA from and against any and all claims, proceedings, damages, liability, and costs (including reasonable attorney fees) incurred by PROTABULA in connection with any claim arising out of (i) any breach or alleged breach of any of CUSTOMER obligations set forth herein, (ii) any acts by CUSTOMER, or (iii) SERVICE or information posted or transmitted by CUSTOMER in connection with the License Service regardless of the type or nature of the claim. CUSTOMER shall cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim. PROTABULA reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by CUSTOMER and CUSTOMER shall not in any event settle any matter without the written consent of PROTABULA.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LIABILITY OF PROTABULA TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER TO PROTABULA DURING THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS. IN NO EVENT WILL PROTABULA BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE ANY SERVICE OR THE LICENSE SERVICE EVEN IF PROTABULA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. CUSTOMER AGREES THAT ANY CLAIM ARISING FROM USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE PROVISION OF ANY LICENSE SERVICES MUST BE MADE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE FIRST DATE SUCH CLAIM FIRST ACCRUED OR SHALL BE DISMISSED AS UNTIMELY AND FOREVER BARRED.

### 14. Term and Termination

This Agreement has a term of one (1) school year (August 1 — July 31) and must be renewed each following school years by CUSTOMER for continued service.
Either CUSTOMER or PROTABULA may cancel or terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other via electronic mail or conventional mail, and all fees for the then-present term of this Agreement shall immediately become fully due and payable.
PROTABULA reserves the right to restrict, suspend or terminate CUSTOMER access to the License Services in whole or in part without notice and without liability, with respect to any breach or threatened breach of any portion of this Agreement. If PROTABULA terminates this Agreement based on a breach of any portion of this Agreement, PROTABULA reserves the right to refuse to provide License Services to CUSTOMER.
Subject to the PROTABULA Privacy Policy, if the Agreement is terminated by PROTABULA for reasons other than breach of this Agreement by CUSTOMER, any student data entered by CUSTOMER will be made available to CUSTOMER either through a third party offsite vault storage provider or directly from PROTABULA for up to ninety (90) days after termination. Charges may apply.

Any modification shall take effect immediately when same is posted to www.ProTabula.com and/or notification via email. CUSTOMER may not assign, sell, distribute, lease, rent, sublicense, or transfer the License Service or the license granted CUSTOMER herein or disclose the License Service to any other person. CUSTOMER continued use of the License Services following any modification shall be conclusively deemed an acceptance of all such modification(s). PROTABULA reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue the License Services or any portion thereof at any time, including the availability of any functional area of the License Service. PROTABULA may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict CUSTOMER access thereto without notice or liability.

### 16. Student Data Escrow

CUSTOMER has the ability to export their data at any time. However, PROTABULA will produce regular backups of any student data of CUSTOMER and will escrow these backups. Assuming all fees owed by CUSTOMER are current and have been paid, CUSTOMER may request that any of the student data of CUSTOMER be copied to physical data storage media and provided to CUSTOMER.
